Custom FX2LP firmware, built with SDCC

This firmware is based on the examples supplied with Dennis Muhlestein's fx2lib. It reports exactly
the same descriptors as the on-board USB firmware used by Digilent in their excellent FPGA devkits.

The vendor ID and product ID of the firmware may be changed by editing the descriptors.a51 file.
